            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may pleaſe Your good Lordſhip: I cannot be ignorant, and ought to bee ſenſible of the wrong which I ſuſtaine in common ſpeech, as if I had beene falſe, or unthankfull to that Noble, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Earle the Earle of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the vulgar ſort, I doe not ſo much regard it; though I love a good name, but yet as an hand maid and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of honeſty and vertue. For I am of his opinion that ſaid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, <hi>That it was a ſhame to him that was a ſuter to the Mistreſſe, to make love to the waiting woman;</hi> and therefore to woo or Court common fame otherwiſe than it followeth upon honeſt courſes, I for my part, finde not my ſelfe fit nor diſpoſed. But on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, there is no worldly thing that concerneth my ſelfe, which I hold more deare, then the good opinion of certaine perſons; amongſt which there is none I would more willingly give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto, then to your Lordſhip. Firſt, becauſe you loved my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and therefore will not bee partiall towards mee, which is part of that I deſire, next, becauſe it hath ever pleaſed you to ſhew your ſelfe to me an honourable friend; and ſo no baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in me to ſeeke to ſatifie you: and laſtly, becauſe I know your Lordſhip is excellently grounded in the true rules and habits of duties and moralities; which muſt be they which ſhall decide this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65137:3"/>matter: wherein (my Lord) my defence needeth to be but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and briefe: namely, that whatſoever I did concerning that action and proceeding, was done in my duty and ſervice to the Queene and the State; in which I would not ſhew my ſelfe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted nor faint hearted for any mans ſake living. For every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, that hath his heart well planted, will forſake his King rather than forſake God, and forſake his friend rather than forſake his King; and yet will forſake any earthly commodity, yea and his owne life in ſome caſes, rather than forſake his friend. I hope the world hath not forgotten theſe degrees, elſe the heathen ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Amicus uſque adaras,</hi> ſhall judge them. And if any man ſhall ſay, that I did officiouſly intrude my ſelfe in that buſineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had no ordinary place; the like may be ſaid of all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in effects that paſſed the hand of the learned counſel, either of State or Revenues theſe many Yeares wherein I was continually uſed. For as your Lordſhip may remember, the Queene knew her ſtrength ſo well as ſhe looked her word ſhould be a warrant; and after the manner of the choiſeſt Princes before her, did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tye her truſt to place, but did ſometime devide private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from office. And I for my part, though I was not ſo unſeene in the world, but I knew the condition was ſubject to envie and perill; yet becauſe I knew againe ſhee was conſtant in her favours, and made an end where ſhe began, and ſpecially, becauſe ſhe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held mee with extraordinary acceſſe, and other demonſtrations of confidence and grace, I reſolved to endure it, in expectation of better. But my ſcope and deſire is, that Your Lordſhip would bee pleaſed to have the Honourable patience, to know the truth in ſome particularity of all that paſſed in this cauſe, wherein I had any part, that you may perceive how honeſt a heart I ever bare to my Soveraigne and to my Country, and to that Nobleman, who had ſo well deſerved of me, and ſo well accepted of my deſervings; whoſe fortune I cannot remember without much griefe. But for any action of mine towards him, there is nothing that paſſed me in my life time, that commeth to my remembrance with more cleareneſſe and leſſe checke of Conſcience: for it will appeare to your Lordſhip, that I was not onely not oppoſite to my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> but that I did occupy the utmoſt of my wit, and adventure my fortune with the Queene to have reintegrated his, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65137:3"/>faithfully and induſtriouſly till his laſt fatall impatience, (for ſo I will call it) after which day there was not time to worke for him, though the ſame my aſſection when it could not worke upon the ſubject proper, went to the next, with no ill effect towards ſome others, who I thinke doe rather not know it, then not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. And this I will aſſure your Lordſhip, I will leave nothing untold that is truth for any enemy that I have to adde; and on the other ſide, I muſt reſerve much which makes for mee, upon many reſpects of duty, which I eſteeme above my credit: and what I have here ſet downe to your Lordſhip, I proteſt, as I hope to have any part in Gods favour, is true.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne, how I did many yeares ſince dedicate my travels and ſtudies to the uſe and (as I may terme it) ſervice of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> which I proteſt before God, I did not making election of him as the likelieſt meane of mine owne advancement, but out of the humor of a man, that ever, from the time I had any uſe of reaſon (whether it were reading upon good bookes, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the example of a good father, or by nature) I loved my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie more than was anſwerable to my fortune, and I held at that time, my Lord to be the fitter inſtrument to doe good to the State: and therefore I applied my ſelfe to him, in a manner which I think happeneth rarely amongſt men: for I did not onely labour care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and induſtriouſly in that he ſet me about, whether it were matter of advice or otherwiſe, but neglecting the Queenes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, mine owne fortune, and in a ſort my vocation, I did nothing but adviſe and ruminate with my ſelfe to the beſt of my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, propoſitions and memorials, of any thing that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his Lordſhips honour, fortune, or ſervice. And when not long after I entred into this courſe, my brother Maſter
<hi>Anthony Bacon</hi> came from beyond the Seas, being a Gentleman whoſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie the world taketh knowledge of for matters of State, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forreigne; I did likewiſe knit his ſervice to be at my Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. And on the other ſide, I muſt and will ever acknowledge my Lords love, truſt, and favour towards me, laſt of all his liberality, having infeoffed me of Land which I ſold for 18. hundred pounds to Maſter
<hi>Reynold Nicholas,</hi> and I think was more worth, and that at ſuch a time and with ſo kinde and noble circumſtances, as the manner was as much as the matter: which though it be but an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65137:4"/>idle digreſſion, yet becauſe I am not willing to bee ſhort in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his benefits, I will preſume to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the relating to you the manner of it, after the Queene had denied mee the Sollicitors place for the which his Lordſhip had been a long and earneſt ſutor on my behalfe, it pleaſed him to come to mee from <hi>Richmond</hi> to <hi>Twicknam</hi> Parke, and brake with me and ſaid Maſter <hi>Bacon,</hi> the Queene hath denied me you place for you, and hath placed another; I know you are the leaſt part of your owne matter, but, you fare ill becauſe you have choſen me for your meane and dependance: you have ſpent your time &amp; thoughts in my matters; I die (theſe were his very words) if I doe not ſomewhat towards your fortune: you ſhall not deny to accept a peece of Land, which I will beſtow upon you. My anſwer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was, that for my fortune it was no great matter: but that his Lordſhips offer made me call to minde what was wont to bee ſaid when I was in <hi>France</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that he was the greateſt Vſurer in <hi>France</hi> becauſe he had turned all his eſtate into Obligations; meaning that he had left himſelfe nothing, but only had bound numbers of perſons to him. Now my Lord (ſaid I) I would not have you immitate his courſe, nor turne your ſtate thus by great gifts into obligations, for you will finde many bad debters. He bad me take no care for that, and preſſed it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſaid My Lord, I ſee I muſt be your homager, and hold land of your gift: but doe you know the manner of doing homage in Law? alwayes it is with a ſaving of his faith to the King and his other Lords, and therefore my Lord (ſaid I) I can bee no more yours then I was, and it may be with the ancient ſavings: and if I grow to be a rich man, you will give me leave to give it backe to ſome of your un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewarded followers. But to returne, ſure I am (though I can arrogate nothing to my ſelfe, but that I was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrance to his Lordſhip) that while I had moſt credit with him, his fortune went on beſt. And yet in two maine points wee alwayes directly and contradictorily differed; which I will mention to your Lordſhip, becauſe it giveth light to all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The one was, I ever ſet this down, that the only courſe to be held with the Queene, was by obſequiouſneſſe and obſervance; and I remember I would uſually gage confidently, that if he would take that courſe conſtantly, and with choiſe of good particulars to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65137:4"/>expreſſe it, the Queen would be brought in time to <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to aske, <hi>What ſhould be done to the man; that the King would honour:</hi> meaning, that her goodneſſe was without limit, where there was a true concurrence, which I knew in her nature to bee true. My Lord on the other ſide had a ſetled opinion, that the Queene could be brought to nothing, but by a kinde of neceſſitie and authority; and I will remember, when by violent courſes at any time he had got his will he would aske me: Now Sir, <hi>whoſe principles be true?</hi> and I would againe ſay to him: <hi>My Lord theſe courſes be like to hot waters, they will help at a pang: but if you uſe them, you ſhal ſpoile the ſtomack, &amp; you ſhal be faine ſtil to make them ſtronger and ſtronger, and in the end they will leſſe their operation:</hi> with much other variety, wherewith I uſed to touch that ſtring. Another point was, I alwayes vehemently diſſwaded him from ſeeking greatnes by a military dependance, or by a popular depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would breed in the Queen jealouſie, in himſelfe preſumption, and in the State perturbation: And I did uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to <hi>Iearus</hi> two wings which were joyned on with wax, and would make him venture to ſoare too high, and then faile him at the height. And I would further ſay unto him: My Lord, ſtand upon two feet, and flie not upon two wings. The two feet, are the two kinds of Juſtice,
<hi>Commutative</hi> and <hi>Distributive:</hi> uſe your greatneſſe for advancing of merit and vertue, and relieving wrongs and burdens, you ſhall need no other art or fineneſſe: but hee would tell mee, that opinion came not from my minde, but from my robe, But it is very true, that I, that never meant to in-thrall my ſelfe to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> nor any other man, more than ſtood with the publike good, did (though I could little prevaile) divert him by all meanes poſſible from courſes of the Warres and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie: for I ſaw plainely the Queene muſt either live or die; if ſhe lived, then the times would bee as in the declination of an old Prince, if ſhee died, the times would bee as in the beginning of a new: and that if his Lordſhip did riſe too faſt in theſe courſes, the times might be dangerous for him, and he for them: Nay, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I was thus plaine with him upon his voyage to the Ilands, when I ſaw every ſpring put forth ſuch actions of Charge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, that I ſaid to him: My Lord, when I came firſt unto you, I tooke you for a Phyſitian that deſired to cure the diſeaſes of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65137:5"/>State; but now I doubt you will bee like thoſe Phyſitians, which can bee content to keepe their patients low, becauſe they would alwayes be in requeſt: which plaineſſe he nevertheleſſe took very well, as he had an excellent care, and was <hi>patientiſſimus veri,</hi> and aſſured mee the caſe of the Realme required it: and I thinke this ſpeech of mine, and the like renewed afterwards, pricked him to write that Apologie which is in many mens hands.</p>
            <p>But this difference in two points ſo maine and materiall, bred in proceſſe of time a diſcontinuance of privatenes (as it is the manner of men ſeldome to communicate where they thinke their courſes not approved) betweene his Lordſhip and my ſelfe; ſo as I was not called nor adviſed with, for ſome yeere and a halfe before his Lordſhips going into
<hi>Ireland</hi> as in former time: yet nevertheleſſe touching his going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it pleaſed him expreſly and in a ſet manner to deſire mine opinion and counſell. At which time I did not onely diſſwade, but proteſt againſt his going, telling him with as much vehemency and aſſeveration as I could, that abſence in that kind would exulcerate the Queens mind whereby it would not be poſſible for him to carry himſelfe ſo, as to give her ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent contentment: nor for her to carry her ſelfe ſo, as to give him ſufficient countenance, which would be ill for her, ill for him, and ill for the State. And becauſe I would omit no argument, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I ſtood alſo upon the difficulty of the action; ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him out of Hiſtories, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was ſuch an enemy as the ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> or <hi>Britons,</hi> or
<hi>Germaines</hi> were, and that wee ſaw how the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had ſuch diſcipline to governe their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſuch donatives to encourage them, and the whole world in a manner to leavie them; yet when they came to deale with enemies which placed their felicity only in liberty, and the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſword, and had the naturall and elementall advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of woods, and bogges, and hardneſſe of bodies, they ever found they had their hands full of them: and therefore concluded that going over with ſuch ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ectation as he did, and through the churliſhneſſe of the enterpriſe not like to anſwer it, would mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſh his reputation; and many other reaſons I uſed ſo as I am ſure I never in any thing in my life time dealt with him in like earneſtneſſe by ſpeech, by writing, and by all the meanes I could deviſe. For I did as plainely ſee his overthrow chained as it were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65137:5"/>by deſtinie to that journey, as it is poſſible for any man to ground a judgement upon future contingents. But my Lord, howſoever his eare was open, yet his heart and reſolution was ſhut againſt that adviſe, whereby his ruine might have been prevented. After my Lords going I ſaw how true a Prophet I was, in regard of the evident alteration which naturally ſucceeded in the Queens mind; and thereupon I was ſtill in watch to find the beſt occaſion that in the weakeneſſe of my power I could either take or miniſter, to pull him out of the fire if it had beene poſſible: and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, me thought I ſaw ſome overture thereof, which I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded readily; a particularity I thinke be knowne to very few, and the which I doe the rather relate to your Lordſhip, becauſe I heare it ſhould be talked, that while my Lord was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I revealed ſome matter againſt him or I cannot tell what, which if it were not a meere ſlander as the reſt is, but had any though never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle colour, was ſurely upon this occaſion. The Queene one day at
<hi>Noneſuch,</hi> a little (as I remember) before <hi>Cuffes</hi> comming over, I attending her, ſhewed a paſſionate diſtate of my Lords proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if they were unfortunate, without judgement, contemptuous, and not without ſome private end of his own and all that might bee, and was pleaſed as ſhe ſpake of it to many that ſhe truſted leaſt, ſo to fall into the like ſpeech with me; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I who was ſtill awake, and true to my grounds which I thought ſureſt for my Lords good, ſaid to this effect: Madam, I know not the particulars of Eſtate, and I know this, that Princes actions muſt have no abrupt periods or concluſions, but otherwiſe I would thinke, that if you had my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> here with a white ſtaffe in his hand, as my Lord of
<hi>Leic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore if you would <hi>imponere bonam clauſulam,</hi> and ſend for him, and ſatisfie him with honour here neare you, if your affaires which (as I have ſaid) I am not acquainted with, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, I think were the beſt way.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65137:6"/>
            <p>Which courſe your Lordſhip knoweth, if it had been taken, then all had been well, and no contempt in my Lords comming over, nor continuance of theſe jealouſies, which that employment of <hi>Ireland</hi> bred, and my Lord here in his former greatneſſe. Well, the next newes that I heard, was, that my Lord was come over, and that he was committed to his Chamber for leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> without the Queenes licence: this was at
<hi>Noneſuch,</hi> where (as my duty was) I came to his Lordſhip, and tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed with him privately about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any houre, and hee asked mine opinion of the courſe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him; I told him: My Lord, <hi>Nubecula est, cito tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi> It is but a miſt: but ſhall I tell your Lordſhip, it is as miſts are, if it goe upwards, it may haps cauſe a ſhowre, if downwards, it will cleare up. And therefore good my Lord carrie it ſo, as you take away by all meanes all ombrages and diſtaſts from the Queen, and eſpecially if I were worthy to adviſe you, (as I have bin by your ſelfe thought, and now your queſtion imports the continuance of that opinion) obſerve three points: Firſt, make not this ceſſation or peace which is concluded with
<hi>Tyrone,</hi> as a ſervice wherein you glorie, but as a ſhuffling up of a proſecution which was not very fortunate. Next, repreſent not to the Queene any neceſſitie of eſtate, whereby as by a coercion or wrench, ſhe ſhould thinke her ſelfe inforced to ſend you backe into
<hi>Ireland</hi> but leave it to her. Thirdly, ſeeke acceſſe
<hi>importune, opportune,</hi> ſeriouſly, ſportingly every way. I remember my Lord was willing to heare mee, but ſake very few words, and ſhaked his head ſometimes, as if hee thought I was in the wrong, but ſure I am, hee did juſt contrary, in every one of theſe three points. After this, during the while ſince my Lord was committed to my Lord Keepers, I came divers ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es to the Queene, as I had uſed to doe, about cauſes of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue and Law buſineſſe, as is well knowne: by reaſon of which acceſſes, according to the ordinary charities of Court, it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, that I was one of them that incenſed the Queene againſt my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches I cannot tell, nor I will not think that they grew any way from her Majeſties own ſpeeches, whoſe memory I will ever honour: if they did, ſhe is with God, and <hi>miſerum eſt ab illis laedi, de quibus non poſſis queri.</hi> But I muſt give this teſtimony to my Lord <hi>Cecill,</hi> that one time in his houſe at he <hi>Savoy</hi> he dealt with me directly, and ſaid to me, Couſin, I heare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65137:6"/>it, but I beleeve it not, that you ſhould do ſome ill office to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> for my part I am meerely paſſive and not active in this action, and I follow the Queen and that heavily, and I lead her not; my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is one that in nature I could conſent with as well as with any one living; the Queene indeed is my Soveraigne, and I am her creature, I may not leeſe her, and the ſame courſe I would wiſh you to take: whereupon I ſatisfied him how farre I was from any ſuch mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. And as ſome imes it commeth to paſſe, that mens inclinations are opened more in a toy, then in a ſerious matter: A little before that time, being about the middle of <hi>Mich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dmaſſe</hi> Terme, Her Majeſtie had a purpoſe to dine at my lodge at <hi>Twicknam</hi> Parke, at which time I had (though I profeſſe not be a Poet) prepared a Sonnet directly tending and alluding to draw on Her Majeſties reconcilement to my Lord, which I remember alſo I ſhewed to a great perſon, and one of my Lords neareſt friends, who commended it: this though it be (is I ſaid) but a toy, yee it ſhewed plainely in what ſpirit I proceeded, and that I was ready not onely to doe my Lord good offices, but to publiſh and declare my ſelfe for him; and never was ſo ambitious of any thing in my life time, as I was to have carried ſome token or favour from her Majeſtie to my Lord, uſing all the art I had, both to procure her Majeſtie to ſend, and my ſelfe to bee the meſſenger: for as to the former, I feared not to alleadge to her, that this proceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my Lord, was a thing towards the people very implauſible, and therefore wiſhed her Majeſtie howſoever ſhee did, yet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her ſelfe of it; and to lay it upon others, and therefore that ſhe ſhould intermixe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r proceeding with ſome immediate graces from her ſelfe, that the world might take knowledge of her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely nature and goodneſſe leſt it ſhould alienate the hearts of her people from her. Which I did ſtand upon, knowing very well, that if ſhee once relented to ſend or viſite, thoſe demonſtrations would prove matter of ſubſtance for my Lords good. And to draw that employment upon my ſelfe, I adviſed her Majeſtie, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God ſhould move her to turne the light of her favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Lord, to make ſignification to him thereof: that her Majeſtie if ſhe did it not in perſon, would at the leaſt uſe ſome ſuch meane as might not intitle themſelves to any part of the thankes, as perſons that were thought mightie with her, to worke her, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65137:7"/>to bring her about; but to uſe ſome ſuch as could not be thought but a meere conduct of her owne goodneſſe: but I could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with her, though I am perſwaded ſhee ſaw plainely whereat I levelled: but thee had me in jealouſie, that I was not hers intirely, but ſtill had inward and deepe reſpects towards my Lord, more than ſtood at that time with her will and pleaſure. About the ſame time I remember an anſwer of mine in a matter which had ſome affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with my Lords cauſe, which though it grew from me, went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about in others names. For her Majeſtie being mightily incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that booke which was dedicated to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being a ſtory of the firſt yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, thinking it a ſeditious prelude to put into the peoples heads boldneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaid, ſhe had good opinion, that there was treaſon in it, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if I could not find any places in it that might be drawn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in caſe of treaſon: whereto I anſwered; for treaſon ſurely I found none, but for fellony very many. And when her Majeſty haſtily ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me wherein; I told her, the Author had committed very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent theft, for he had taken moſt of the ſentences of
<hi>Cornelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> and tranſlated them into Engliſh, and put them into his text. And another time when the Queene would not be perſwaded, that it was his writing whoſe name was to it, but that it had ſome more miſchievous Author, and ſaid with great indignation, that ſhee would have him racked to produce his Author, I replyed, Nay Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, he is a Doctor, never racke his perſon, but racke his ſtile; let him have pen inke, and paper, and help of books, and be enjoyned to continue the ſtory wherein it breaketh off, and I will undertake, by collecting the ſtiles, to judge whether he were the Author or no. But for the maine matter, ſure I am, when the Queene at that time asked mine opinion of my Lords caſe, I ever in one tenor, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her: that they were faults which the Law might tearme Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, becauſe they were the tranſgreſſion of her particular dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inſtructions: but then what defence might be made of them, in regard of the great intereſt the perſon had in her Majeſties favour, in regard of the greatneſſe of his place, and the ampleneſſe of his Commiſſion; in regard of the nature of the buſineſſe being action of War, which in common caſes cannot be tyed to ſtrictneſſe of inſtructions, in regard of the diſtance of the place, having alſo a Sea between, that demands and commands, muſt be ſubject to wind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65137:7"/>and weather; in regard of a counſell of State in <hi>Ireland</hi> which he had at his backe to avow his actions upon, and laſtly in regard of a good intention that he would alleage for himſelfe, which I told her in ſome religions was held to bee a ſufficient diſpenſation for Gods Commandements, much more for Princes. In all theſe regards, I beſought her Majeſtie to be adviſed again &amp; again, how ſhe brought the cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e into any publike queſtion: Nay, I went further, for I told her, my Lord was an eloquent and well ſpoken man, and beſides his eloquence of nature or art, he had an eloquence of accident which paſſed them both, which was the pittie and benevolence of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and therefore that when he ſhould come to his anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, I doubted his words would have ſo unequall paſſage above theirs that ſhould charge him, as would not be for her Majeſties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and therefore wiſhed the concluſion might bee, that they might wrap it up privately between themſelves, and that ſhe would reſtore my Lord to his former attendance, with ſome addition of her our to take away diſcontent. But this I will never deny, that I did ſhew no approbation generally of his being ſent backe againe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> both becauſe it would have carried a repugnancy with my former diſcourſe, and becauſe I was in mine owne heart fully perſwaded, that it was not good neither for the Queene, nor for the State, nor for himſelfe: and yet I did not diſſwade it neither, but left it ever as <hi>locus lubricus.</hi> For this particularitie I doe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that after your Lordſhip was named for the place in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not long before your going, it pleaſed her Majeſtie at <hi>White Hall</hi> to ſpeake to me of that nomination: at which time I ſaid to her: Surely Madam, if you meane not to imploy my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> thither againe, your Majeſtie cannot make a better choiſe, and was going on to ſhew ſome reaſon; and her Majeſtie interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with great paſſion: <hi>Eſſex!</hi> (ſaid ſhe) whenſoever I ſend <hi>Eſſex</hi> back againe into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> I will marrie you, claime it of me: whereunto I ſaid; Well Madam, I will releaſe that contract if his going be for the good of your State. Immediately after the Queene had thought of a courſe (which was alſo executed) to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what publiſhed in the Starre-Chamber, for the ſatisfaction of the world touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his reſtraint, and my Lord of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> not to be called to it, but occaſion to be taken by reaſon of ſome Libels then diſperſed; which when her Majeſtie propounded unto
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65137:8"/>mee, I was utterly againſt it; and told her plainely, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would ſay, that my Lord was wounded upon his backe, and that Juſtice had her ballance taken from her, which ever conſiſted of an accuſation and defence, with many other quicke and ſignificant tearmes to that purpoſe: in ſo much that I remember I ſaid, that my Lord <hi>in foro famae</hi> was too hard for her; and therefore wiſhed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r as I had done before, to wrap it up privately. And certainly I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her at that time, which was rare with me: For I call to minde that both the
<hi>Chriſtmaſſe, Lent,</hi> and <hi>Eaſter</hi> term following, though I came diverſe times to her upon Law buſineſſes, yet me thought her face and manner was not ſo cleare and open to me, as it was at the firſt. And ſhe did directly charge me, that I was abſent that day at the Star-Chamber, which was very true but I alleadged ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of body to excuſe it: and during all the time foreſaid, there was <hi>altum ſilentium</hi> from her to mee touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſes. But towards the end of <hi>Eaſter</hi> tearme, her Majeſtie brake with me, and told me that ſhe had found my words true, for that the proceeding in the Star-Chamber had done no good, but rather kindled factious bruits (as ſhe tearmed them) then quenched them, and therefore that ſhee was determined now for the ſatisfaction of the world, to proceed againſt my Lord in the Star-Chamber by an information <hi>ore tenus,</hi> and to have my Lord brought to his anſwer: howbeit ſhe ſaid ſhe would aſſure me that whatſoever ſhe did, ſhold be towards my Lord <hi>ad caſtigationem, &amp; non ad deſtructionem,</hi> as indeed ſhe had often repeated the ſame phraſe before: whereunto I ſaid (to the end utterly to divert her:) Madam if you will have me to ſpeake to you as Frier <hi>Bacons</hi> head ſpake, that ſaid firſt, <hi>Time is,</hi> and then, <hi>Time was,</hi> and, <hi>time would never be;</hi> for certainly (ſaid I) it is now far to late, the matter is cold and hath taken too much winde; whereat ſhe ſeemed againe offended and roſe from me, and that reſolution for a while continued; and after, in the beginning of Midſomer tearme, I attending her, and finding her ſetled in that reſolution (which I heard of alſo otherwiſe) thee falling upon the like ſpeech, it is true, that ſeeing no other remedy, I ſaid to her ſlightly, Why Madam, if you will needs have a proceeding, you were beſt have it in ſome ſuch ſort as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpake of his Miſtris, <hi>Eſt aliquid luce patente minus,</hi> to make a councel table matter of it, and there an end; which ſpeech ſhe ſeem'd to take in ill part but yet I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65137:8"/>think it did good at that time; and hope to divert that courſe of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by information in the Star-Chamber. Nevertheleſſe, it pleaſed her to make a more ſolemne matter of the proceeding, and ſome few dayes after when order was given that the matter ſhould bee heard at <hi>Yorke</hi> houſe, before an aſſembly of Councellors, Peerns, and Judges, and ſome audience of men of qualitie to be admitted: and then did ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Counſellors ſend for us of the Learned Counſell, and notifie her Majeſties pleaſure unto us, ſave that it was ſaid to mee openly by one of them, that her Majeſty was not yet reſolved whether ſhe would have me forborne into buſineſſe or no. And hereupon might ariſe that other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and untrue ſpeech that I heare is raiſed of me, how I was a futer to be uſed againſt my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> at that time: for it is very true, that I that knew well what hath paſſed betweene the Queene and mee, and what occaſion I had given her both of diſtaſt and diſtruſt, in croſſing her diſpoſition, by ſtanding ſtedfaſtly for my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſuſpecting it alſo to be a ſtratagem ariſing from ſome particular emulation, I write to her two or three words of complement, ſignifying to her Majeſtie, that if ſhe would be pleaſed to ſpare me in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſe, out of the conſideration ſhe took of my obligation towards him, I ſhould reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it for owne of her higheſt favours; but otherwiſe deſiring her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to thinke that I knew the degrees of duties, and that no particular obligation whatſoever to any ſubject could ſupplant or weaken that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſſe of duty that I did owe and beare to her and her ſervices; and this was the goodly ſute I made, being a reſpect no man that had his wits could have omitted: but nevertheleſſe I had a further reach in it, for I judged that dayes worke would be a full period of any bitterneſſe or harſhneſſe betweene the Queene and my Lord, and therefore if I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ſelfe fully according to her mind at that time, which could not doe my Lord any manner of prejudice, I ſhould keep my credit with her ever after, whereby to do my Lord ſervice. Hereupon the next newes that I heard, was, that we were all ſent for againe, and that her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties pleaſure was, we al ſhould have parts in the buſineſſe; and the Lords falling into diſtribution of our parts, it was allotted to me, that I ſhould ſet forth ſome undutifull carriage of my Lord, in giving occaſion and countenance to a ſeditious Pamphet, as it was tearmed, which was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto him, which was the booke before mentioned of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Whereupon I replyed to that allotment; and ſaid to their Lordſhips, that it was an old matter, and had no manner of coherence with the reſt of the charge, being matters of Ireland, and therefore that I having beene wronged by bruits before, this would expoſe me to them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65137:9"/>more; and it would be ſaid, I gave in evidence mine owne tales. It was anſwered againe with good ſhew, that becauſe it was conſidered how I ſtood tyed to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> therefore that part was thought fitteſt for me which did him leaſt hurt: for that, whereas all the reſt was matter of charge and accuſation, this only was but matter of caveat and admonition. Wherewith though I was in mine one mind little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, becauſe I knew well a man were better to bee charged with ſome faults, then admoniſhed of ſome others: yet the concluſion binding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queenes pleaſure directly, <hi>volens nolens,</hi> I could not avoyd that part that was laid upon me; which part if in the delivery I did handle not tenderly (though no man before me did in ſo cleare tearms free my Lord from all diſloyalty as I did) that your Lordſhip knoweth, muſt be aſcribed to the ſuperior duty I did owe to the Queenes fame and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in a publike proceeding, and partly to the intention I had to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my ſelfe in credit and ſtrength with the Queene, the better to be able to doe my Lord good offices afterwards: for as ſoone as this day was paſt, I loſt no time, but the very next day following (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) I attended her Majeſty, fully reſolved to try and put in ure my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indevour (ſo far as in my weaknes could give furtherance) to bring my Lord againe ſpeedily into Court and into favour, and knowing (as I ſuppoſed at leaſt) how the Queen was to be uſed, I thought that to make her conceive that the matter went well then, was the way to make her leave off there; and I remember well, I ſaid to her, you have now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam obtained victory over two things which the greateſt Princes in the world cannot at their wills ſubdue: the one is over Fame, the other is over a great minde: for ſurely the world is now (I hope) reaſonably well ſatisfied; and for my Lord, he did ſhew that humiliation towards your Majeſtie, as I am perſwaded he was never in his life time more fit for your favour then he is now: therefore your Majeſtie will not marre it by lingring, but give over at the beſt, and now you have made ſo good a full point receive him again with tenderneſſe, I ſhall then think that all that is paſt, is for the beſt. Whereat I remember ſhe took excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great contentment, and did often iterate and put me in mind, that ſhe hath ever ſaid, that her proceedings ſhould be <hi>ad reparationem,</hi> and not
<hi>ad ruinam,</hi> as who ſaith, that now was the time I ſhould well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that that ſaying of hers ſhould prove true. And further ſhee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mee to ſet downe in writing all that paſſed that day. I obeyed her commandement, and within ſome few dayes brought her againe the narration, which I did read unto her at two ſeverall after noones: and when I came to that part that ſet forth my Lords owne anſwer (which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65137:9"/>was my principall care) I do well beare in my mind, that ſhe was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily moved with it, in kindnes &amp; relenting towards my Lord, and told me afterwards (ſpeaking how wel I had expreſſed my Lords part) thats he perceived old love would not eaſily be forgotten: whereto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſuddenly, that I hoped ſhe meant that by her ſelfe. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I did adviſe her, that now ſhe had taken a repreſentation of the matter to her ſelfe, that ſhe would let it go no further: for Madam (ſaid I) the fire blazeth well already, what ſhould you tumble it: and beſides it may pleaſe you to keep a convenience with your ſelfe in this caſe: for ſince you expreſſe direction was, there ſhould be no Regiſter nor Cleark to take this ſentence, nor no record or memoriall made up of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, why ſhould you now do that popularly, which you would not admit to be done judicially? Wherupon ſhe did agree, that that writing ſhold be ſuppreſſed, and I think there were not 5. perſons that ever ſaw it. But from this time forth during the whole latter end of that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, while the court was at <hi>Noneſuch</hi> &amp;
<hi>Otlands,</hi> I made it my taske to take &amp; give occaſions for my
<hi>Lords</hi> reintegration in his fortune: w<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> my Intention did alſo ſignifie to my Lord, as ſoone as ever he was at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; wherby I might without perill of the Queens indignation write to him, and having received from his Lordſhip a courteous and loving acceptation of my good will and indeavours, I did apply it in all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to the Queen which were very many at that time, and purpoſely ſought and wrought upon other variable pretences, but only and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that purpoſe. And on the other ſide, I did not forbeare to give my Lord from time to time faithfull advertiſement what I found, and what I wiſhed. And I drew for him by his appointment ſome letters to her Majeſty. which though I knew well his Lorſhips gift and ſtile was farre better than mine owne, yet becauſe he required it alleadging that by his long reſtraint he was grown almoſt a ſtranger to the Queens preſent conceipts, I was ready to performe it: and ſure I am for the ſpace of ſixe weeks, or two moneths it proſpered ſo well, as I expected continually his reſtoring to his attendance. And I was never better welcom to the Queen, nor more made of, then when I ſpake fulleſt and boldeſt for him: in which kind the particulars were exceeding many, wherof for an example I will remember to your Lordſhip one or two; as at one time I call to mind, her Majeſtie was ſpeaking of a fellow that undertooke to cure, or at leaſt, to eaſe my brother of his Goute, and asked me how it went forwards; and I told her Majeſtie, that at the firſt hee received good by it, but after in the courſe of his cure hee found himſelfe at a ſtay or rather worſe: the QVEENE ſaid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65137:10"/>again, I will tell you <hi>Bacon</hi> the error of it, the manner of theſe Phiſitions and eſpecially theſe Empericks is to bontinue one kinde of medicine, which at the firſt is proper, being to draw out the ill humor, but after they have not the diſcretion to change their medicine, but apply ſtill drawing medicines, when they ſhould rather intend to cure and corroborate the part. Good Lord Madam (ſaid I) how wiſely and aptly can you ſpeak and diſcerne of Phyſicke miniſtred to the body, and conſider not that there is the like occaſion of Phyſick miniſtred to the mind: as now in caſe of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> your Princely word ever was, that you intended ever to reforme his mind, and not ruine his fortune: I know well you cannot but think that you have drawne the humor ſufficiently, and therefore it were more than time, and it were but for doubt of mortifying or exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, that you did apply and miniſter ſtrength and comfort unto him: for theſe ſame gradations of yours are fitter to corrupt then correct any mind of greatnes. And an other time I remember ſhe told me for news, that my LORD had written unto her ſome very dutifull letters, and that ſhe had bin moved by them, and when ſhe took it to be but a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a ſuite for the renuing of his farme of ſweet wines: whereunto I replyed; O Madam, how doth your Majeſtie conſter of theſe things, as if theſe two could not ſtand well together, which indeed nature hath planted in all creatures. For there are but two ſympathies, the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection, the other towards <hi>Preſervation.</hi> That to perfection, as the iron contendeth to the Loadſtone: that to Preſervation, as the vine will creepe towards a ſtake or prop that ſtands by it, not for any love to the ſtake, but to uphold it ſelfe. And therefore Madam, you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh my Lords deſire to do you ſervice, is as to his perfection that which he thinkes himſelfe to bee borne for: whereas his deſire to obtaine this thing of you, is but for a ſuſtentation. And not to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with many other particulars like unto theſe, it was at the ſelfe ſame time that I did draw with my Lords privitie, and by his appointment, two letters, the one written as from my brother, the other as an anſwer returned from my Lord, both to bee by mee in ſecret manner ſhewed to the Queene, which it pleaſed my Lord very ſtrangely to mention at the barre: the ſcope of which we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e but to repreſent and picture forth unto her Majeſty my Lords mind to be ſuch, as I knew her Majeſty would fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt have had it, which letters whoſoever ſhal ſee, (for they cannot now be retracted or altered, being by reaſon of my brothers, or his Lordſhips ſervants delivery, long ſince comming into diverſe hands) let him judg, ſpecially if he knew the Queene, and do remember thoſe times, whether they were not the labours of one that ſought to bring the Queene about for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his good. The troth is, that the iſſue of all his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65137:10"/>grew to this, that the Queen by ſome ſlackneſſe of my Lords, as I imagine, liked him worſe and worſe, and grew more incenſed towards him. Then, ſhe remembring belike the continuall, and inceſſant, and confident ſpeeches and courſes that I had held on my Lords ſide, becam utterly alienated from me, and for the ſpace of (at leaſt) three monthe, which was betweene <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> and
<hi>New-yeares</hi> tide following, would not as much as look on me, but turned away from mee with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and purpoſe-like diſcountenance whereſoever ſhe ſaw me: and at ſuch time as I deſired to ſpeake with her about Law buſineſſe, over ſent me forth very ſlight refuſals, inſomuch as it is moſt true, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after
<hi>New-yeares</hi> tide I deſired to ſpeak with her; and being admitted to her, I dealt with her plainely and ſaid: Madam I ſee you withdraw your favour from me, and now I have loſt many friends for your ſake, I ſhall leeſe you too: you have put me like one of thoſe that the Frenchmen call
<hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> that ſerve on foot before horſmen, ſo have you put mee into matters of envie without place, or without ſtrength: and I know at Cheſſe a pawne before the King, is ever much plaid upon: a great many love me not, becauſe they thinke I have been againſt my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex;</hi> and you love mee not, becauſe you know I have been for him: yet will I never repent me, that I have dealt in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of heart towards you both, without reſpect of cautions to my ſelfe: and therefore
<hi>vivus videnſque pereo.</hi> If I doe breake my necke, I ſhall doe it in a manner as Mr. <hi>Dorrington</hi> did it, which walked on the battlements of the Church many dayes, and tooke a view and ſurvey where he ſhould fall: and ſo Madam (ſaid I) I am not ſimple, but that I take a proſpect of mine overthrow, only I thought I would tell you ſo much, that you may know that it was faith, and not folly that brought me into it, and ſo I will pray for you. Vpon which ſpeeches of mine uttered with ſome paſſion, it is true her Majeſtie was exceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and accumulated a number of kinde and gratious words upon me, and willed mee to reſt upon this, <hi>Gratia mea ſufficit,</hi> and a number of other ſenſible and tender words and demonſtrations, ſuch as more could not be; but as touching my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex, ne verbum quidem.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I departed, reſting then determined to meddle no more in the matter; that, that I ſaw would overthrow mee, and not be able to doe him any good. And thus I made mine own peace with mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence at that time; and this was the laſt time I ſaw her Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 8. of <hi>February,</hi> which was the day of my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his misfortune, after which time, for that I performed at the barre in my publike ſervice, your Lordſhip knoweth by the rules of duty, that I was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65137:11"/>to doe it honeſtly, and without any prevarication: but for any putting my ſelfe into it, I proteſt before God, I never moved neither the Queen, nor any perſon living concerning my being uſed in the ſervice, either of evidence or examination: but it was meerly laid upon me with the reſt of my fellowes. And for the time which paſſed I meane between the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignement and my Lords ſuffering, I will remember I was but once with the Queen: at what time though I durſt not deale directly formy LORD as things then ſtood; yet generally I did both commend her Majeſties mercie, tearming it to her as an excellent balme that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſtill from her Soveraigne hands, and made an excellent odour in the ſenſes of her people: and not only ſo, but I took hardineſſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, not the fact; for that I durſt not, but the danger, telling her that if ſome baſe or cruell minded perſons had entred into ſuch an action, it might have cauſed much bloud and combuſtion: but it appeared well they were ſuch as knew not how to play the malefactors, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words which I now omit. And for the reſt of the carriage of my ſelfe in that ſervice, I have many honourable witneſſes that can tell, that the next day after my Lords arraignment, by my diligence and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching the quality and nature of the offendors, 6. of 9. were ſtayed, which otherwiſe had bin attainted, I bringing their Lordſhips let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for their ſtay, after the Jury was ſworn to paſſe upon them; ſo neare it went: and how carefull I was, and made it my part, that whoſoever was in trouble about that matter, aſſoone as ever his caſe was ſufficiently knowne and defined of, might not continue in reſtraint, but bee ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: and many other parts, which I am well aſſured ſtood with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an honeſt man. But indeed I will not deny for the caſe of <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the Queene demanding my opinion of it, I told her, I thought it was as hard as many of the reſt; but what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe at that time I had ſeene only his accuſation, &amp; had never bin preſent at any examination of his: and the matter ſo ſtanding. I had bin very untrue to my ſervice, if I had not delivered that opinion. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon a reexamination of ſome that charged him, who weakned their own teſtimony; and eſpecially hearing himſelfe <hi>viva voce,</hi> I went inſtantly to the Queen out of the ſoundneſſe of my conſcience, and not not regarding what opinion I had formerly delivered, told her Majeſty, I was ſatified and reſolved in my conſcience, that for the reputation of the action, the plot was to countenance the action further by him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his place, then they had indeed any intereſt or intelligence with him. It is very true alſo, about that time her Majeſty taking a liking of my pen, upon that which I had done before concerning the proceeding
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65137:11"/>at <hi>Yorke-houſe,</hi> and likewiſe upon ſome other declarations, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time by her appointment I put in writing, commanded me to penne that book, which was publiſhed for the better ſatisfaction of the world: which I did, but ſo, as never Secretary had more particular, and expreſſe directions, and inſtructions in every point how to guide my hand in it: and not only ſo, but after that I had made a firſt draught thereof and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to certaine principall Councellers, by her Majeſties appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was peruſed, weighed, cenſured, altered, and made almoſt anew, writing according to their Lordſhips better conſideration, wherein their Lordſhips and my ſelfe both were as religious and curious of truth, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſatisfaction: and my ſelfe indeed gave only words and form of ſtile in purſuing their direction. And after it had paſſed their allowance, it was again exactly peruſed by the Queen her ſelfe, and ſome alteratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made again by her appointment: nay, and after it was ſet to print, the Queen, who as your Lordſhip knoweth, as ſhe was excellent in great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo ſhe was exquiſite in ſmall: and noted that I could not forget my ancient reſpect to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in terming him ever My Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in almoſt every page of the booke, which ſhee thought not fit, but would have it made,
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> or the late <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex:</hi> whereupon of force it was printed <hi>de novo,</hi> and the firſt copies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by her peremptory commandement. And this my good Lord, to my furtheſt remembrance, is all that paſſed wherein I had part, which I have ſet downe as neare as I could in the very words and ſpeeches that were uſed, not becauſe they are worthy the repetition, I meane thoſe of mine own; but to the end your Lordſhip may lively and plainly diſcerne between the face of truth, and a ſmooth tale. And the rather alſo becauſe in things that paſſed a good while ſince, the very words and phraſes did ſometimes bring to my remembrance the matters, wherein I report me to your Honourable judgments, whether you do not ſee the traces of an honeſt man: and had I bin as well believed either by the Queene or by my Lord, as I was well heard by them both, my Lord had bin fortunate, and ſo lead my ſelfe in his fortune.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, I humbly pray your Lordſhip to pardon me for troubling you with this long Narration, and that you will vouchſafe to hold me in your good opinion, till you know I have deſerved, or finde that I ſhall deſerve the contrary; and even ſo I continue.</p>
